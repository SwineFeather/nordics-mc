## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### `achievement_definitions`
Stores the base achievement categories.
```sql
CREATE TABLE achievement_definitions (
  id text PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  stat text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### `achievement_tiers`
Stores individual achievement tiers with thresholds and rewards.
```sql
CREATE TABLE achievement_tiers (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  achievement_id text REFERENCES achievement_definitions(id),
  tier integer NOT NULL,
  name text NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  threshold numeric NOT NULL,
  icon text NOT NULL,
  points integer NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(achievement_id, tier)
);
```

#### `unlocked_achievements`
Tracks which achievements each player has unlocked and claimed.
```sql
CREATE TABLE unlocked_achievements (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  player_uuid text REFERENCES players(uuid),
  tier_id uuid REFERENCES achievement_tiers(id),
  unlocked_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  claimed_at timestamp with time zone,
  is_claimed boolean DEFAULT false,
  UNIQUE(player_uuid, tier_id)
);
```

#### `level_definitions`
Defines the level progression system.
```sql
CREATE TABLE level_definitions (
  level integer PRIMARY KEY,
  xp_required bigint NOT NULL,
  title text NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  description text DEFAULT '',
  color text DEFAULT '#3b82f6',
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Key Functions

#### `calculate_level_from_xp(player_xp bigint)`
Calculates a player's current level, XP progress, and level information based on total XP.

#### `claim_achievement(p_player_uuid text, p_tier_id uuid)`
Claims an achievement for a player, awards XP, and updates their level.

#### `get_claimable_achievements(p_player_uuid text)`
Returns all achievements a player can claim based on their current stats.

#### `sync_all_achievements()`
Synchronizes achievements for all players based on their current stats.

## Stat Mapping

The system maps Minecraft statistics to achievement categories:
