# 🚀 New Nordics Website is Live!

Hey everyone! We finally got a proper website up and running. It's been months in the making and we're pretty excited to share it.

## What's on there?

**Towns & Nations** - Browse towns, check out politics, see who's running what

**Economy** - Create companies, set up shops, trade with others

**Maps** - Historical political maps and interactive locations 

**Wiki** - Community docs and auto-generated pages

**Community** - Forums, player directory, server news

## Important!

Use **/login** in-game first to link your Minecraft account to the website.

## What's next?

Still adding more features like achievements, economy stuff, and community events.

**Happy exploring!** 🌐
