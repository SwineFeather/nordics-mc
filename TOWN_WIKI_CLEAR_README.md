# Clear Town Wiki Pages

This document explains how to clear all town wiki pages content in the Nordics World wiki system.

## Overview

The system provides multiple ways to clear town wiki pages:

1. **Admin Panel Button** - A user-friendly button in the admin interface
2. **Service Method** - Programmatic access via `SupabaseWikiService.clearTownWikiPages()`
3. **SQL Migration** - Database migration script
4. **Command Line Script** - Node.js script for direct execution

## What Gets Cleared

The system identifies and clears town wiki pages using multiple criteria:

- Pages in the "towns" category
- Pages with slugs starting with "town-" or ending with "-town"
- Pages with titles matching actual town names from the database
- Pages in subcategories with "town" in their name or slug

## Method 1: Admin Panel Button

1. Navigate to `/admin` in your application
2. Look for the "Clear Town Wiki Pages" card
3. Click the "Clear All Town Wiki Pages" button
4. Confirm the action (requires double confirmation)
5. Wait for the process to complete

**Features:**
- Double confirmation to prevent accidental clearing
- Real-time feedback on success/failure
- Shows count of cleared pages
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Method 2: Service Method

```typescript
import { SupabaseWikiService } from '@/services/supabaseWikiService';

// Clear all town wiki pages
const result = await SupabaseWikiService.clearTownWikiPages();

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Cleared ${result.clearedCount} town wiki pages`);
} else {
  console.error(`Failed: ${result.error}`);
}
```

**Return Value:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  clearedCount: number;
  error?: string;
}
```

## Method 3: SQL Migration

Run the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250131000005_clear_town_wiki_pages.sql`

This migration:
- Updates all town-related wiki pages to have empty content
- Updates timestamps to reflect the change
- Logs the number of pages cleared

## Method 4: Command Line Script

### Prerequisites

1. Install `tsx` for TypeScript execution:
   ```bash
   npm install -g tsx
   ```

2. Set environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```

### Usage

```bash
npm run clear-town-wiki
```

Or directly:
```bash
tsx src/scripts/clearTownWikiPages.ts
```
