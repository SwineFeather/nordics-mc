-- Step-by-step migration to add company hierarchy and town location
-- This migration handles potential conflicts and ensures proper data types

-- Step 1: Check if columns already exist and drop them if they do
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    -- Drop town_id column if it exists (regardless of type)
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
               WHERE table_name = 'companies' AND column_name = 'town_id') THEN
        ALTER TABLE companies DROP COLUMN town_id;
    END IF;
    
    -- Drop parent_company_id column if it exists
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
               WHERE table_name = 'companies' AND column_name = 'parent_company_id') THEN
        ALTER TABLE companies DROP COLUMN parent_company_id;
    END IF;
    
    -- Drop company_type column if it exists
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
               WHERE table_name = 'companies' AND column_name = 'company_type') THEN
        ALTER TABLE companies DROP COLUMN company_type;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Step 2: Add the columns with correct data types
-- Add parent company relationship
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN parent_company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Add town location (using UUID to match towns table)
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN town_id UUID REFERENCES towns(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Add company type to distinguish between parent companies and subsidiaries
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN company_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'independent' CHECK (company_type IN ('parent', 'subsidiary', 'independent'));

-- Step 3: Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_companies_parent_id ON companies(parent_company_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_companies_town_id ON companies(town_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_companies_company_type ON companies(company_type);

-- Step 4: Add database functions for hierarchy management
