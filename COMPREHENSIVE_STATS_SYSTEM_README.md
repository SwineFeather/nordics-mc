# Comprehensive Stats System

## Overview

The Comprehensive Stats System ensures that all players have complete statistics data by collecting stats from multiple sources and initializing all possible stats from `possible_stats.json`. This system addresses the issue where individual player pages and achievements were showing most stats as 0.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the system had these issues:
- **Incomplete Data Sources**: Only fetched stats from individual JSON files and database
- **Missing Stats**: Most players were missing the majority of their ~8100 possible stats
- **Inconsistent Processing**: Different components used different methods to process stats
- **No Fallback**: No mechanism to ensure all stats are present

## Solution

The Comprehensive Stats System provides:

### 1. **Complete Stats Initialization**
- Initializes all ~8100 possible stats from `possible_stats.json` to 0 for every player
- Ensures no stats are missing from the database

### 2. **Multi-Source Data Collection**
- **Individual JSON Files** (highest priority): `/stats/data/playerdata/${uuid}.json`
- **Database Stats** (medium priority): Existing stats in `player_stats` table
- **Default Values** (lowest priority): All stats initialized to 0

### 3. **Proper Stat Name Mapping**
- Maps `possible_stats.json` structure to correct stat names
- Handles categories: `custom`, `mined`, `used`, `crafted`, `killed`, `killed_by`, `picked_up`, `dropped`, `broken`

### 4. **Comprehensive Services**

#### `comprehensiveStatsService.ts`
- `createComprehensivePlayerStats(uuid)`: Creates complete stats for a player
- `getComprehensivePlayerStats(uuid)`: Gets comprehensive stats with caching
- `updatePlayerStatsWithComprehensiveData(uuid)`: Updates database with comprehensive data

#### `playerStatsSyncService.ts`
- `PlayerStatsSyncService.syncAllPlayerStats()`: Syncs all players
- `PlayerStatsSyncService.syncPlayerStats(uuid)`: Syncs single player
- `PlayerStatsSyncService.initializePlayerStatsTable()`: Initializes table with all stats

#### `playerStatsService.ts`
- `getAllStatsForPlayer(uuid)`: Gets all stats with metadata
- `getPlayerStat(uuid, statName)`: Gets specific stat
- `getPlayerStats(uuid, statNames)`: Gets multiple stats
- `getPlayerStatsSummary(uuid)`: Gets key metrics summary

## How to Use

### Option 1: Admin Panel (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `/admin` page
2. Find the "Comprehensive Stats Sync" card
3. Click "Sync All Player Stats"
4. Wait for the process to complete
5. Check individual player pages and achievements

### Option 2: Command Line Script
```bash
# Run the comprehensive stats sync script
npx ts-node src/scripts/syncAllPlayerStats.ts
```

### Option 3: Programmatic Usage
```typescript
import { PlayerStatsSyncService } from '@/services/playerStatsSyncService';
import { createComprehensivePlayerStats } from '@/services/comprehensiveStatsService';

// Sync all players
const result = await PlayerStatsSyncService.syncAllPlayerStats();
console.log(`Synced ${result.success}/${result.total} players`);

// Get comprehensive stats for a single player
const stats = await createComprehensivePlayerStats(playerUuid);
console.log('Player stats:', stats);
```

## Stat Categories and Mapping

The system handles these stat categories from `possible_stats.json`:

| Category | Stat Name Pattern | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| `custom` | `statName` | `play_one_minute` |
| `mined` | `statName_mined` | `diamond_ore_mined` |
| `used` | `statName_used` | `diamond_pickaxe_used` |
| `crafted` | `statName_crafted` | `wooden_pickaxe_crafted` |
| `killed` | `statName_killed` | `zombie_killed` |
| `killed_by` | `killed_by_statName` | `killed_by_zombie` |
| `picked_up` | `statName_picked_up` | `diamond_picked_up` |
| `dropped` | `statName_dropped` | `dirt_dropped` |
| `broken` | `statName_broken` | `diamond_pickaxe_broken` |

## Data Priority

1. **Individual JSON Files** (highest priority)
   - Source: `/stats/data/playerdata/${uuid}.json`
   - Contains: Most recent and detailed player stats
   - Format: `{ "statName": { "value": number } }`

2. **Database Stats** (medium priority)
   - Source: `player_stats` table
   - Contains: Previously synced stats
   - Used when: JSON file stats are 0 or missing

3. **Default Values** (lowest priority)
   - Source: `possible_stats.json`
   - Contains: All possible stats initialized to 0
   - Ensures: No missing stats

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch Processing**: Processes players in batches of 5 to avoid overwhelming the system
- **Caching**: Comprehensive stats are cached to avoid repeated file fetches
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during sync operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with detailed error reporting

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Sync Status
```typescript
import { PlayerStatsSyncService } from '@/services/playerStatsSyncService';

// Get stats summary for a player
const summary = await PlayerStatsSyncService.getPlayerStatsSummary(uuid);
console.log(`Player has ${summary.nonZeroStats}/${summary.totalStats} non-zero stats`);
```

### Debug Individual Player
```typescript
import { createComprehensivePlayerStats } from '@/services/comprehensiveStatsService';

// Get all stats for debugging
const stats = await createComprehensivePlayerStats(uuid);
console.log('All player stats:', stats);
```

## Integration Points

### Player Profile Pages
- Uses `getComprehensivePlayerStats()` for complete stat display
- Ensures all stats are available for achievement processing

### Achievement System
- Uses comprehensive stats for achievement calculations
- No more missing stats causing achievement issues

### Community Pages
- Uses comprehensive stats for leaderboards and comparisons
- Consistent data across all components

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Stats Still Showing as 0**
   - Run the comprehensive stats sync
   - Check if individual JSON files exist for the player
   - Verify database connection

2. **Sync Failing**
   - Check network connectivity to JSON files
   - Verify database permissions
   - Check console for detailed error messages

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce batch size in `PlayerStatsSyncService`
   - Increase delays between batches
   - Monitor database performance

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if a player's JSON file exists
curl -I /stats/data/playerdata/{uuid}.json

# Check database stats
SELECT player_uuid, jsonb_object_keys(stats) as stat_count 
FROM player_stats 
WHERE player_uuid = '{uuid}';

# Run sync for specific player
npx ts-node -e "
import { PlayerStatsSyncService } from './src/services/playerStatsSyncService';
PlayerStatsSyncService.syncPlayerStats('{uuid}').then(console.log);
"
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Incremental Sync**: Only sync changed stats
- **Background Sync**: Automatic periodic sync
- **Stats Validation**: Validate stat values for reasonableness
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel processing and caching improvements
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based real-time stat updates
