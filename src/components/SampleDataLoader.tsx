## The Journey Begins

*They say the sea gives and the sea takes. But there comes a tide once in an age, when the sea does neither. It simply... opens.*

From the north they came‚Äîeight ships adrift in fog. Their hulls battered, their sails torn, yet their banners still flew. These were no warbands or raiders. These were townsmen, traders, farmers, hunters.

## The New Lands

Now, they plant new banners in lands like:
- **Ashendell** - Where ash trees grow as tall as mountains
- **Brigantia** - Rolling hills dotted with ancient stones  
- **Shadowmere** - Mystical wetlands where magic flows freely
- **Goldenvale** - Fertile plains perfect for new settlements

*This lore forms the foundation of our world.*`;
