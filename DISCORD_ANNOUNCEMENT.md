# 🌐 New Nordics Website is Live!

Hey @everyone! We finally got a proper website up and running. It's been months in the making and we're excited to share it with you all!

## 🔗 Check it out: [www.nordics.world](https://www.nordics.world)

## What's on the website?

**🏘️ Towns & Nations** - Browse all towns, check out politics, see who's running what, change your town/nation emblem, and explore the server's political landscape

**💼 Economy** - Create and manage companies, set up shops, trade with others, and build your business empire

**🗺️ Maps** - Historical political maps and interactive locations

**💬 Community** - Forums, player directory, server news, and chat with ingame players

**📚 Wiki** - Community documentation, auto-generated town pages, and easy editing for everyone

**📰 News & Updates** - Instant patch notes, server changes, and announcements posted immediately

## ⚠️ Important: In-game setup required!

Before you can log into the website, you need to use the **`/login`** command in-game first. This links your Minecraft account to the website so you can access all the features.


## :dart: Why this matters?

This isn't just another server website - it's the server's **permanent legacy**. Even if you're not playing anymore, you can always come back and see what's new, catch up on the new towns & nations, or look back to the good old days.

**See you on the website!** :compass::star2:
